We extend LinearOpMode here because it gives us more control over what we are doing, we define
the loop and everything the robot does. This can be a bit dangerous to go right into though as
loops need to have a proper interrupt or the apps will crash (which has some issues, it takes time
to restart them, which isn't a problem in normal testing but in the heat of competition this can
cause serious delays in switching to the autonomous programs.

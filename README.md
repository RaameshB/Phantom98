### Hello!

This is FTC Team Phantom's Version of the First Tech Challenge SDK. It is slightly modified in 
order to suit our needs.

### Downloading The SDK
Go to the Releases Section and download the latest stable release (so ignore the pre-releases). 
The clean slate versions do not have custom example code from me (so download that one). There may 
be a release with example code added in. This is my custom code that I have made as a base. If you 
are following other instructions you do not need this.

### NOTE: 
The versioning here works a bit weird, for example we could have version B2.2.4. So this is
actually split into two different types of versions. The first is the B2, the B stands for the beta
and the 2 stands for having example code. If it has a 1 it will not have sample code. The second
set, the 2.4 means that it is version 2.4. The idea is we start at version 1.0 and progress up,
adding 0.1 every new version. Here's a key explaining the first version in better depth.

B = Beta
P = Production
1 = No Custom Example Code
2 = Includes Custom Example Code
Ex. P1 = Production Version without Example Code
